The project involves analyzing and comparing the socioeconomic dynamics related to housing in Maryland, Philadelphia and Virginia. The dataset includes information on median gross rent, median household income, population, and rent burden for various counties or areas within these regions. The project aims to understand the correlation between key variables, particularly focusing on the relationship between social and economic factors.

To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data, a dashboard is being developed. The dashboard will feature visualizations, such as plots and trend lines, to showcase how the variables interact. The unique identifiers assigned to Maryland and Philadelphia allow for a direct comparison within the same visual representation.

1) Correlation Analysis:

The primary goal is to visually assess and compare the correlation between median gross rent and median household income in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Insights gained from these comparisons can help identify patterns and trends that may be indicative of broader economic dynamics.

2) Regional Disparities:

The dashboard aids in identifying regional disparities within Maryland, providing a nuanced understanding of how housing-related variables vary across different counties or areas.

3) Decision Support:

The visualizations generated by the dashboard serve as a decision support tool for policymakers, urban planners, or stakeholders involved in housing and economic development. The insights derived can inform strategies for addressing housing affordability concerns and fostering economic growth.

4) Comparative Analysis:

By directly comparing Maryland and Philadelphia, the dashboard enables a comparative analysis of housing and income dynamics between the two regions. This comparison can highlight similarities, differences, and potential factors influencing these trends.

In summary, the project aims to provide actionable insights into the relationship between housing and income in Maryland and Philadelphia through the development of an interactive dashboard. This tool will not only enhance understanding but also support informed decision-making for stakeholders concerned with regional economic development and housing policies.
